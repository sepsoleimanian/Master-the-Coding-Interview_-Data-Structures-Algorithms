# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms - Python Implementation

Welcome to the repository for **Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms**. This course, authored by **Lincoln Neyman** on Udemy, provides comprehensive training to prepare you for technical interviews by mastering data structures and algorithms. The goal of this repository is to offer **Python** implementations of the concepts covered in the course, which originally uses **JavaScript**.

## About the Course

This course is designed to help you:

- Understand **data structures** and their practical applications.
- Master common **algorithms** used in technical interviews.
- Solve challenging coding problems with confidence.
- Prepare effectively for interviews at top tech companies.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms taught in the course. While the original course materials use **JavaScript**, this repository serves as a Python equivalent for those who prefer Python for coding interviews.

### Key Topics Covered:

1. **Big O Notation** â€“ Understand the efficiency of your code.
2. **Data Structures**:
   - Arrays
   - Stacks and Queues
   - Linked Lists
   - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - Heaps
   - Hash Tables
   - Graphs
3. **Algorithms**:
   - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
   - Searching (Binary Search)
   - Recursion
   - Dynamic Programming

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** through the folders to find the relevant Python implementation for each data structure or algorithm.

3. **Run the Python files** to explore the implementation, and try modifying or adding your own test cases.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** is required to run the code in this repository.
